# WeCan-RESTAPI

# Book CRUD REST API:  WeCan Technical Assignment submission. 

A RESTful API that follows an MVC architecture, which allows users to add / edit / remove books from their own book lists or to transfer books between each other.  No actual database is used, but a "UserBank" object instance is used globally in runtime to store and manage users.  Consequently, no data persistence exists when the runtime is terminated and the user list will refresh.
